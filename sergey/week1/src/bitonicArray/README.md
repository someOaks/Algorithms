## Search in a bitonic array.
 >An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of
 integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers.
 Write a program that, given a bitonic array of n distinct integer
 values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

> + Standard version: Use ~ 3lg⁡n compares in the worst case.
> + Signing bonus: Use ~ 2lg⁡n compares in the worst case (and prove
 that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than ~2lg⁡n compares
 in the worst case).

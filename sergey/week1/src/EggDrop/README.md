## Egg drop

> Egg drop. Suppose that you have an nnn-story building (with floors 1
through n) and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor
 T or higher and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a
 strategy to determine the value of T given the following limitations
 on the number of eggs and tosses:

>    Version 0: 1 egg, ≤T  tosses.
>    Version 1: ~1lg⁡n  eggs and ~1lg⁡n  tosses.
>    Version 2: ~lg⁡T  eggs and ~2lg⁡T  tosses.
>    Version 3: 2  eggs and ~2√n tosses.
>    Version 4: 2  eggs and ≤c√T tosses for some fixed constant c.
